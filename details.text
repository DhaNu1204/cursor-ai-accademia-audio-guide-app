Benvenuti - welcome to the Accademia Gallery in Florence, or as we say in Italian, "Galleria dell'Accademia di Firenze." I'm excited to be your virtual tour guide today as we explore one of Italy's most celebrated museums, which welcomes nearly a million visitors each year.


ID-2  A Brief History

Audio-Track-02
ID-2-thumbnail
ID-2-main-image
The story of the Accademia begins in 1784, when Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo of Lorraine transformed a medieval convent and 15th-century hospital into something extraordinary. His vision wasn't just to create a museum, but a living academy where young artists could study and draw inspiration from masterpieces of the past.

Over the years, the collection grew in fascinating ways. When monasteries were dissolved in the late 18th century, many religious paintings found their new home here. But the gallery's most famous moment came in 1873, when Michelangelo's David was moved here from its outdoor location in Piazza della Signoria. The David was later joined by Michelangelo's Slaves and other sculptures, earning the Accademia its nickname as the "Michelangelo Museum."

Today, our tour will take us through the gallery's most important spaces:

- The Hall of the Colossus, with masterpieces by Botticelli and other Renaissance masters
- The Gallery of the Slaves, where Michelangelo's unfinished sculptures tell powerful stories
- The Tribune of David, home to the world's most famous statue
- The Nineteenth Century Hall, showcasing neoclassical sculptures
- The Medieval Rooms, with their golden religious paintings

Are you ready to begin? Let's start our journey in the Hall of the Colossus, where some remarkable surprises await us...

ID-3 The Hall of the Colossus

Audio-Track-03
ID-3-thumbnail
ID-3-main-image
As we enter this impressive first room, you might be wondering about its name. Interestingly, it's not named after the magnificent Giambologna sculpture you see in the center, but rather after a plaster model of one of Rome's famous Dioscuri statues that once stood here in the early 1900s.




ID-4 The Rape of the Sabine Women

Audio-Track-04
ID-4-thumbnail
ID-4-main-image
Let's begin with the room's centerpiece - Giambologna's dramatic "Rape of the Sabine Women." Created in 1582, this plaster model stands over four meters tall and is remarkably well-preserved. It's actually quite rare to find such a large clay model intact after all these centuries. The artist created this as a preparation for the marble version that still stands under the Loggia dei Lanzi in Piazza della Signoria.

Look at how the figures spiral upward in a complex dance of motion - a Roman soldier, a Sabine maiden, and a helpless father below. Here's an interesting detail: when Giambologna first created this piece, it didn't have a specific subject. He simply wanted to demonstrate his virtuosity by carving three intertwined figures from a single block of marble. The title came later!

Botticelli's Masterpieces

ID-5 Madonna del Mare

Audio-Track-05
ID-5-thumbnail
ID-5-main-image
Along this wall, we find three exceptional works by Sandro Botticelli. The smallest but perhaps most charming is the "Madonna del Mare" from 1470. Notice the delicate seascape in the background - it's why we call it the Madonna of the Sea. Look for the tiny golden star on Mary's shoulder, symbolizing her title "Stella Maris" - Star of the Sea.

ID-6 Madonna and Child with St. John and Two Angels

Audio-Track-06
ID-6-thumbnail
ID-6-main-image
Next to “Madonna del Mare” hangs the "Madonna and Child with St. John and Two Angels" from 1465-1470. This work shows Botticelli's mastery at creating serene, graceful figures. The Virgin's downcast eyes and the tender gesture of the infant Jesus create an intimate moment of motherly love.


ID-7 Madonna and Child with Saints

Audio-Track-07
ID-7-thumbnail
ID-7-main-image
The third Botticelli, "Madonna and Child with Saints," painted between 1495 and 1496, is a more formal composition. See the classical marble throne? Around it stand several saints, including Saints Cosmas and Damian in red robes - they were the patron saints of the powerful Medici family.


From Paolo Uccello to Perugino

ID-8 Scenes of Hermit Life

Audio-Track-08
ID-8-thumbnail
ID-8-main-image
Don't miss Paolo Uccello's fascinating "Scenes of Hermit Life" from 1460. In this unique canvas, Uccello depicts various scenes of monastic life, including St. Francis receiving the stigmata and St. Jerome in prayer. The artist's distinctive style combines religious devotion with an almost mathematical precision in depicting space.


ID-9 Assumption of the Virgin

Audio-Track-09
ID-9-thumbnail
ID-9-main-image
One of the room's largest and most impressive works is Perugino's "Assumption of the Virgin," also known as the Vallombrosa Altarpiece, from 1500. Look at how Mary rises within an almond-shaped mandorla, surrounded by musical angels. Below, four saints witness the miracle - from left to right, you'll see Saint John Gualbert (founder of the Vallombrosian order), Saint Bernard degli Uberti, Saint Benedict, and Saint Michael in his classical armor.


ID-10 The Adimari Cassone

Audio-Track-10
ID-10-thumbnail
ID-10-main-image
Before we leave this room, there's one more remarkable piece you shouldn't miss - the Cassone Adimari, painted around 1450 by Giovanni di Ser Giovanni, known as Lo Scheggia (who, by the way, was Masaccio's brother). This elongated panel wasn't originally meant to hang on a wall - it was the front of a wedding chest! Look closely at the details of the wedding procession. See those elegant couples parading under the draped canopies? Their clothes are decorated with real gold leaf. In the background, you can spot Florence's famous Baptistery, while musicians play on a platform to the left.

Now, shall we move on to the Gallery of the Slaves? Here, we'll encounter some of Michelangelo's most powerful and mysterious works...

ID-11 The Gallery of the Slaves

Audio-Track-11
ID-11-thumbnail
ID-11-main-image
As we enter from the Hall of the Colossus, let's pause for a moment by this striking bronze bust on our right. This is Michelangelo himself, captured in his later years by his devoted student Daniele da Volterra. Created in 1564, the year of Michelangelo's death, it shows us the man behind the masterpieces we're about to encounter.

Look closely at his face - you might notice his famously broken nose, a reminder of a youthful incident that helped shape his fierce character. As a young artist studying in the Medici gardens, Michelangelo made a cutting remark about a fellow student's drawing. That student, Pietro Torrigiano, responded with a punch that would leave its mark forever. The story goes that Lorenzo de' Medici was so furious he banished Torrigiano from Florence!

But this bust shows us more than just Michelangelo's appearance. In the intense gaze and furrowed brow, we see the determination that drove him to become the greatest sculptor of his age. Born in 1475 in a small town called Caprese, he came to Florence as a young boy and showed such remarkable talent that by age 13, he was apprenticed to the painter Ghirlandaio. The Medici family soon recognized his genius and took him under their wing, setting him on the path to greatness.

This bronze portrait was created by someone who knew Michelangelo intimately - Daniele da Volterra worked alongside the master in his final years, becoming not just a student but a trusted friend. He captured Michelangelo at almost 90 years old, his face marked by decades of relentless work and artistic passion.

As we continue down this gallery to view the Slaves and ultimately the David, keep this image of their creator in mind. Each chisel mark we'll see was made by the hands of this remarkable man, who devoted his life to freeing figures from stone.

Now, let's explore the masterpieces he left behind...

ID-12 The Slaves

Audio-Track-12
ID-12-thumbnail
ID-12-main-image
As we move down this dramatic corridor, we encounter four extraordinary figures that seem to be struggling to break free from their marble prisons. These are Michelangelo's famous Slaves, created between 1519 and 1534. Originally, they were meant to be part of an ambitious project - the tomb of Pope Julius II, which was planned to be a massive monument for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.


ID-13 Young Slave

Audio-Track-13
ID-13-thumbnail
ID-13-main-image
Look at the first figure on your left - this is the Young Slave. Notice how his knees are slightly bent, as if taking a weary step, while his left arm is folded across his face. Parts of him emerge perfectly formed from the marble, while others remain rough and unfinished. These aren't flaws - they're glimpses into Michelangelo's creative process. The master believed that the figure already existed within the block of marble; his job was simply to liberate it.




ID-14 Awakening Slave

Audio-Track-14
ID-14-thumbnail
ID-14-main-image
Next comes the Awakening Slave, perhaps the most dramatic of the group. See how his head tilts backward, his face barely visible, as if he's emerging from a dream. His right arm rises at an angle, matching the movement of his left leg - a pose suggesting both struggle and awakening. If you look closely at the sides of the marble block, you can still see the marks where Michelangelo began his work.

ID-15  Bearded Slave

Audio-Track-15
ID-15-thumbnail
ID-15-main-image
The Bearded Slave, the most complete of the four, shows Michelangelo's mastery of anatomy. Study the careful rendering of the beard and curled hair, the defined musculature of the torso. A strip of cloth wraps around his chest - these figures were meant to represent prisoners, though they've come to symbolize something far more universal: the struggle of the human spirit to break free from material constraints.

ID-16  Atlas Slave

Audio-Track-16
ID-16-thumbnail
ID-16-main-image
Finally, we come to the Atlas Slave, named for the way he appears to bear a tremendous weight on his shoulders. Like the mythical titan condemned to hold up the sky, this figure seems crushed by his burden, yet his muscles suggest continued resistance. Even in its unfinished state, you can feel the power of the intended pose.

The unfinished nature of these sculptures, which might seem like a shortcoming, has become one of their most compelling features. They show us something remarkable - the process of creation itself. Each chisel mark tells a story, showing us exactly how Michelangelo worked, moving from rough stone to polished flesh. They're like a lesson in sculpture, frozen in time.

These powerful figures stood in Florence's Boboli Gardens for centuries before being moved here to the Accademia in 1908. Today, they create a perfect pathway leading to Michelangelo's greatest masterpiece. As we continue toward the Tribune of David, these Slaves remind us of the artist's belief that every block of stone contains a sculpture - the artist's task is simply to discover it.







Final Treasures of the Slaves Gallery

ID-17 Saint Matthew


Audio-Track-17
ID-17-thumbnail
ID-17-main-image
Before we reach the Tribune of David, two more remarkable works demand our attention. First is the unfinished Saint Matthew, created by Michelangelo in 1505-1506. This powerful figure tells a fascinating story of ambition and interruption. Imagine Florence in 1505 - the cathedral authorities commissioned Michelangelo to create twelve massive apostle statues. Saint Matthew was the first and, as it turned out, the only one he would begin.

Look at how the saint emerges from the marble block - you can see his torso twisting dynamically, one leg stepping forward, while his features remain partially trapped in stone. The book of his Gospel is barely visible in his hands. Why was it never finished? Pope Julius II called Michelangelo to Rome for what would become another famously unfinished project - the Pope's own tomb, for which our Slaves were originally intended.

ID-18 The Palestrina Pietà

Audio-Track-18
ID-18-thumbnail
ID-18-main-image
Our final piece in this gallery is the Palestrina Pietà, named after the church of Santa Rosalia in Palestrina where it was discovered. While its attribution to Michelangelo is debated today, it offers us fascinating insights into the master's influence on other sculptors of his time.

Here's an interesting detail you might miss - this sculpture holds a secret in its very material. The artists of the Renaissance often reused ancient Roman marble, and this Pietà was actually carved from a classical architectural block. If you could see the back, you'd notice traces of ancient decorations still visible!


ID-19 The Approach to David

Audio-Track-19
ID-19-thumbnail
ID-19-main-image
As we near the end of this gallery, notice how the architecture itself begins to tell a story. See how the corridor opens into a spectacular tribune ahead? This space was specifically designed by architect Emilio de Fabris in 1872 to showcase Michelangelo's David. Look up at the circular skylight - it was carefully planned to bathe the statue in natural light.

The way this gallery builds anticipation is no accident. Just as a cathedral's nave leads to its altar, this corridor, lined with Michelangelo's unfinished works, leads us to his most perfect creation. Are you ready to meet David?





ID-20 The Tribune of David

A Home Fit for a Masterpiece

Audio-Track-20
ID-20-thumbnail
ID-20-main-image
As we enter this magnificent domed space, pause for a moment to take in the setting. This tribune was designed specifically for David in 1872 by architect Emilio de Fabris. Notice how the natural light streams down from the circular skylight above, creating an almost heavenly atmosphere around the statue. This lighting wasn't accidental - it was carefully planned to highlight every detail of Michelangelo's masterpiece.

The Journey of David

The story of this colossal statue is as remarkable as the work itself. In 1501, the Guild of Wool Merchants presented Michelangelo with an enormous block of marble - but it wasn't pristine. For forty years, this massive piece had lain abandoned in the cathedral workshop, partially carved and then rejected by other sculptors because of its imperfections. They called these flaws "taroli" - tiny holes in the marble that made it extremely challenging to work with.

But Michelangelo, only 26 years old at the time, saw possibilities where others saw problems. From 1501 to 1504, he worked in complete secrecy, transforming this rejected stone into what would become one of the most famous artworks in history. Imagine the anticipation in Florence when the work was finally unveiled!

A Symbol of Florence

Originally, David was meant to stand high on a buttress of Florence's cathedral. But when it was completed, everyone realized this masterpiece needed to be where people could see it up close. A committee of artists, including Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci, was formed to decide its location. They chose the political heart of Florence - the Piazza della Signoria, in front of the Palazzo Vecchio.

There, David stood as a symbol of the Florentine Republic for over 350 years, facing Rome as if in defiance. But by the 19th century, concerns about weather damage led to a momentous decision. In 1873, the statue was carefully moved to this purpose-built tribune in the Accademia. The journey took four days, with David traveling on specially laid railroad tracks through the streets of Florence.

A Work with Battle Scars

Like any veteran, David bears the marks of history. In 1527, during a riot, the left arm was damaged when a bench was thrown from the Palazzo Vecchio. Pieces of the arm were carefully collected by Giorgio Vasari and Francesco Salviati and later restored. If you look closely at the right side, you can still see small cracks at the wrist and elbow.

In more recent times, in 1991, the statue faced another challenge when a man attacked it with a hammer, damaging the left foot. Thanks to the skill of modern restorers, these repairs are almost invisible today.

Now that we understand the remarkable journey of this masterpiece, let's look more closely at the statue itself and discover the revolutionary way Michelangelo chose to portray this biblical hero...


ID-21 The Iconography of Michelangelo's David

A Revolutionary Vision

Audio-Track-21
ID-21-thumbnail
ID-21-main-image
Standing before us at an imposing height of 17 feet (5.17 meters), David represents a radical departure from earlier interpretations of this biblical hero. Previous artists like Donatello and Verrocchio had shown David as a young boy after his victory, standing triumphantly over Goliath's severed head. Michelangelo instead chose to capture the moment before the battle - the instant of decision.

The Anatomy of Courage

Look at David's pose - what sculptors call contrapposto, where the weight rests on one leg while the other is relaxed. His head turns to the left, his brow furrowed in concentration. The right hand is relaxed at his side, while the left, raised to his shoulder, holds the strap of his sling. The stone for his sling rests in his right hand, partially concealed behind his thigh.

Notice something interesting about the proportions? The head and right hand are slightly larger than they should be. This wasn't a mistake - Michelangelo deliberately emphasized these features. The head represents divine wisdom and intellect, while the powerful right hand symbolizes action. Together, they remind us that David's victory came through both wisdom and courage.

 More Than Just a Hero

In Michelangelo's interpretation, David becomes more than just a biblical figure. His nudity recalls classical Greek and Roman sculptures of heroes and gods, linking him to the humanist ideals of the Renaissance. The perfect proportions of his body - except for those intentionally enlarged features - represent the Renaissance ideal of human perfection.

Look at his expression - the intensity of his gaze, the tension in his neck muscles, the visible veins in his arms. This is a David who thinks as much as he acts. He's not just a warrior but a symbol of mind over matter, of rational thought directing physical power.


 A Political Statement

For Renaissance Florence, David represented something deeply political. This young man facing a giant resonated with a city-state that saw itself as a small but proud republic standing up to more powerful rivals. The direction of David's gaze - originally staring toward Rome - was no accident.

The Details That Amaze

Take a moment to appreciate the astounding level of detail. Notice how Michelangelo carved the veins in David's arms, the muscles in his torso, even the contraction of his neck muscles as he turns his head. The curls of his hair, the definition of his muscles, the subtle shift of weight in his stance - every detail contributes to the sense of latent energy, of a figure caught in that electric moment between thought and action.

This is why David has captivated viewers for over five centuries. He represents not just a moment of biblical history, but the endless human capacity for courage, beauty, and triumph against overwhelming odds. In him, we see both the perfection of the human form and the power of the human spirit.


ID-22 Transition to the Nineteenth Century Hall

Audio-Track-22
ID-22-thumbnail
ID-22-main-image
After experiencing the power and perfection of David, you might wonder what impact Michelangelo's masterpiece had on future generations of artists. As we leave the Tribune, we're about to discover exactly that. Let's make our way to the Nineteenth Century Hall, where we'll see how Michelangelo's influence lived on through the works of sculptors like Lorenzo Bartolini and Luigi Pampaloni.

This next space might surprise you - it's actually housed in what was once the women's ward of the old San Matteo Hospital. Here, you'll find yourself stepping into what feels like a 19th-century sculptor's workshop, where the creative process itself becomes art. The contrast between Michelangelo's divine perfection and these later artists' more intimate, human works tells us fascinating stories about how artistic ideals evolved over three centuries.

Shall we explore this next chapter in Florence's artistic story?


ID-23 The Nineteenth Century Hall

Audio-Track-23
ID-23-thumbnail
ID-23-main-image
Welcome to what feels like a sculptor's studio frozen in time. Since 1985, this space has housed an extraordinary collection of plaster models, primarily the work of Lorenzo Bartolini, one of the most celebrated sculptors of 19th-century Italy. But these aren't just copies or reproductions - they're original artist's models, and they have fascinating stories to tell.

Look closely at these plaster figures and you might notice something unusual - their surfaces are covered with tiny dots. These aren't damage or age; they're measuring points used by sculptors to transfer their designs from plaster to marble. Think of them as a 19th-century version of 3D printing coordinates! Using a tool called a pantograph, artists could precisely replicate these models in marble, allowing workshops to meet the growing demand from Europe's rising bourgeoisie.

ID-24 The Napoleon Connection

Audio-Track-24
ID-24-thumbnail
ID-24-main-image
Among the most intriguing pieces here are Bartolini's Napoleonic busts. Within the first decade of the 1800s, Bartolini created portraits of several members of the Bonaparte family. You can see Caroline, Queen of Naples; Hortense Beauharnais, Napoleon's stepdaughter; and even a young future Napoleon III. Recently, in June 2023, the gallery acquired a remarkable marble bust of Napoleon himself, showing the emperor in an unusually contemplative mood.

ID-25 A Gallery of Faces

Audio-Track-25
ID-25-thumbnail
ID-25-main-image
The numerous portrait busts here offer us a wonderful glimpse into 19th-century fashion and society. Notice how hairstyles and clothing change through the decades - it's like a three-dimensional fashion magazine from two centuries ago! Before photography became widespread, these sculptors captured the faces of their era in plaster and marble.



ID-26 Machiavelli and More

Audio-Track-26
ID-26-thumbnail
ID-26-main-image
Don't miss Bartolini's model for his statue of Machiavelli, created between 1843 and 1846. The great political thinker is shown in characteristic contemplation, one hand thoughtfully placed under his chin, the other resting on what's likely his masterwork, "The Prince." If you've visited the Uffizi's portico, you might recognize this - the final marble version still stands there today.



ID-27 A Hidden Treasure

Audio-Track-27
ID-27-thumbnail
ID-27-main-image
Before we move on to our final stop in the Medieval Rooms, take a moment to notice the fresco on the wall. Created by Jacopo Carrucci, known as Pontormo, around 1514, it shows daily life in the hospital that once occupied this space. You can see nuns tending to the sick and the Blessed Humility washing feet - a touching reminder of this building's long history of service to Florence.

Shall we continue to our final destination, where the glowing gold backgrounds of medieval paintings await us?


ID-28 The Medieval Rooms

Audio-Track-28
ID-28-thumbnail
ID-28-main-image
As we enter these final rooms of our tour, we're stepping back in time to the 13th and 14th centuries. Here, gold leaf gleams from every wall, creating an atmosphere that medieval worshippers would have found familiar. These rooms house one of the finest collections of late medieval Florentine painting in the world.

ID-29 Understanding Medieval Art

Audio-Track-29
ID-29-thumbnail
ID-29-main-image
Notice how different these paintings feel from the Renaissance works we saw earlier. These artists weren't concerned with realistic perspective or anatomical accuracy - they were painting for a higher purpose. These works served as the "Biblia Pauperum" - the Poor Man's Bible - visual stories that helped illiterate worshippers understand sacred teachings.

Look at all that gold! The brilliant gold backgrounds aren't just decorative. They served two important purposes: they demonstrated the patron's wealth and status, and more importantly, they created a heavenly light meant to inspire spiritual contemplation. Think of these paintings as windows into the divine.


Masterworks of Faith

ID-30 St. Mary Magdalene and Eight Stories from Her Life

Audio-Track-30
ID-30-thumbnail
ID-30-main-image
Let's look at some highlights. The "St. Mary Magdalene and Eight Stories from Her Life" by the Master of Magdalene (1280-1285) shows us how medieval artists told stories. The central figure of Mary Magdalene stands tall, completely covered by her miraculous long brown hair, while eight smaller scenes around her tell her story like a graphic novel.






ID-31 Tree of Life

Audio-Track-31
ID-31-thumbnail
ID-31-main-image
One of our most extraordinary pieces is Pacino di Buonaguida's "Tree of Life" from 1305-1310. It's a remarkable spiritual diagram of salvation history. The tree grows from Mount Calvary, with Christ crucified at its center. Each round fruit contains a miniature scene from Jesus's life, painted with incredible detail. Look for the pelican at the top - it's shown feeding its young with its own blood, a medieval symbol of Christ's sacrifice.




Personal Devotion

ID-32 Christ in Pietà

Audio-Track-32
ID-32-thumbnail
ID-32-main-image
These rooms also contain fascinating examples of private devotional art. The small portable altars you see were like medieval travel accessories for wealthy pilgrims - personal-sized devotional paintings they could carry for spiritual protection on dangerous journeys. Giovanni da Milano's "Christ in Pietà" from 1365 is a perfect example, complete with the artist's signature and the coats of arms of the families who commissioned it.
The Final Masterpieces
ID-33 Orcagna's Pentecost
Audio-Track-33
ID-33-thumbnail
ID-33-main-image
Let's pause before this magnificent triptych of Pentecost, created between 1362 and 1365. Its creator, Andrea di Cione, was known as 'Orcagna' - a name derived from 'Arcangelo' or Archangel. He ran one of Florence's most prestigious workshops along with his brothers Matteo, Nardo, and Jacopo. Giorgio Vasari tells us this stunning work was made for the high altar of the Florentine church of Saints Apostles and Blaise.
Using tempera on panel with gold leaf gilding, Orcagna brings the dramatic moment of Pentecost to life. Look at how the six Apostles kneel around the Virgin Mary, who stands majestically at the center. Above her head, the white dove of the Holy Spirit descends, while tongues of fire appear above each figure. Notice something interesting? While most Apostles gaze toward Mary, one figure in brilliant ultramarine blue turns to look at us, inviting us to witness this divine moment.
The attention to detail is extraordinary - from the statuesque modeling of the figures to the sumptuous rendering of the robes. See how Mary's embroidered garment catches the light, and how the pair of angels seems to float against that radiant gold background. This isn't just decoration - that gold represents divine light itself.

ID-34 Giotto's Shepherd's Head
Audio-Track-34
ID-34-thumbnail
ID-34-main-image
Now we come to a precious fragment that changed the course of art history. This Shepherd's Head, painted around 1320, comes from a fresco in the Badia Fiorentina. It's by Giotto di Bondone, who revolutionized medieval painting while working in Florence in the mid-14th century. You might know his famous frescoes in the Bardi and Peruzzi chapels of Santa Croce.
What makes this fragment so special? Look at the shepherd's face - see how natural and lifelike it appears? This was radical for its time. Instead of the flat, stylized figures typical of medieval art, Giotto gave us real people with real expressions. Even the frame is remarkable, decorated with plant and flower motifs that imitate polychrome marble.
ID-35 Bernardo Daddi's Painted Cross

Audio-Track-35
ID-35-thumbnail
ID-35-main-image
Our final masterpiece is this impressive Painted Cross by Bernardo Daddi, one of Giotto's most talented pupils. Created between 1340 and 1345 for the Florentian church of San Donato in Polverosa, it shows how Giotto's revolutionary naturalism influenced the next generation of artists.
This type of cross would have hung above the high altar, commanding attention from every corner of the church. But what you're seeing is more than just a beautiful object - it represents a crucial shift in how artists depicted Christ's suffering. Following the innovations of Cimabue and Giotto, Daddi shows us the "Christus Patiens" - Christ suffering, his body rendered with touching naturalism. On either side, Mary and St. John the Evangelist mourn, while three scenes from the Passion unfold around them.
Together, these works tell the story of a revolutionary moment in art history. From Giotto's groundbreaking naturalism to his student Daddi's emotional cross, to Orcagna's masterful synthesis of old and new traditions, we see medieval art transforming into something new - the first stirrings of what would become the Renaissance.
